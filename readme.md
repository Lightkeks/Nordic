Nordic is a Worldgenerator which creates a world that will have a nordic looking. There are continents and smaller islands, lakes, a custom Treetype, some caves and all ores/mushrooms/flowers/lava... whatever you need. Most of the screenshots were made during development using the seed 1337 if you want to try this world. You might experience some strange spawning locations and some strange blocks around the generated lakes, but it should be very rare.

You have to know how to edit the bukkit.yml or use a plugin that does this part for you, like Pinapp.
The command & permission beneath are not needed if you use Pinapp or edit the bukkit.yml, i just left them in so its possible to take a look on a Nordic world without doing any configuration stuff.

This fork targets Paper 1.21.5 and requires Java 21. Worlds can be created via Multiverse using the generator name "Nordic".
The terrain now uses taiga biomes with spruce forests. Weather behaves normally according to the server settings.
Tree populators create randomised spruce woodlands. Large trees appear a bit more often among many smaller ones. The new terrain settings raise mountains into steep cliffs and carve deep fjord-like inlets with longer creeks.
Small spruce trees now spawn across all heights in great numbers, blanketing even high cliffs so forests feel lush and dense.
